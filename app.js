//this variable is an object type because we a assigned an object key word to it 
var personOne = {};
//  the first bracket does not create a new javascript object
// this is just typescripts code. This code tells typescript about the types of the key that will be in the object
// this is done so that typescript knows the structure of the object
var personTwo = {};
//EX:
var personThree = {
    name: 'Angelika',
    age: 22
};
//this code...
var personFour = {
    name: 'Angelika',
    age: 22
};
//and this code are the same
//the empty brackets just mean that this variable is n object
var personFive = {
    name: 'Angelika',
    age: 22
};
console.log(personThree.name);
